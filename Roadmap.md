# Entity Framework Core (EF Core)

Below is the schedule and roadmap for EF Core. Please note that these dates and feature plans are all subject to change. As with any project of this size it is difficult to predict exactly when things will land. Even so, we think it's important to be as open and transparent as possible about our plans so that our users can have the right expectations and create their plans accordingly.

## Schedule

The schedule for the initial release of EF Core is in-sync with the ASP.NET Core schedule [which you can find here](https://github.com/aspnet/Home/wiki/Roadmap). 

While EF Core is not strictly tied to ASP.NET Core (and has many use cases outside of ASP.NET), it is an integral part of ASP.NET Core and it is therefore important that we have a stable release of EF Core to support the ASP.NET Core release.

## Features

Because EF Core is a new code base, the presence of a feature in past releases does not mean that the feature is implemented in EF Core. For this reason, we have provided a list of what is implemented and what we plan to implement before the initial release of EF Core. 

**We have also provided a list of features that we think are important but will not be enabled in the initial release. This means that EF6.x continues to be the best version of EF for a number of applications until these features are implemented in the EF Core code base.**

### Core 1.0.0 Features

#### Implemented

The following features are already implemented and included in the last official pre-release. Note that features on this list may still have bugs that need to be resolved and the APIs/design may still change as we progress toward the first stable release.

* Modelling
 * **Basic modelling** based on POCO entities with get/set properties. The common property types from the BCL are supported (`int`, `string`, etc.).
 * **Built-in conventions** that build an initial model based on the shape of the entity classes.
 * **Fluent API** allows you to override the `OnModelCreating` method on your context to further configure the model that was discovered by convention.
 * **Data annotations** are attributes that can be added to your entity classes/properties and will influence the EF model (i.e. adding [Required] will let EF know that a property is required).
 * **TPH inheritance pattern** allows entities in an inheritance hierarchy to be saved to a single table using a discriminator column to identify they entity type for a given record in the database.
 * **Relationships** between entities based on navigation and foreign key properties.
 * **Shadow state properties** (properties that are part of the model but do not have a corresponding property in the CLR class).
 * **Alternate keys** and the ability to define a relationship that targets an alternate key.
 * **Model validation** that detects invalid patterns in the model and provides helpful error messages.
 * **Key value generation** including client-side generation and database generation.
 * **Relational: Table mapping** allows entities to be mapped to tables/columns.
		
* Change Tracking
 * **Snapshot change tracking** based on recording the original values of an entity when it is retrieved from the database.
 * **Notification change tracking** allows your entities to notify the change tracker when property values are modified.
 * **Accessing tracked state** of entities (via `DbContext.Entry` and `DbContext.ChangeTracker`).
 * **Attaching detached entities/graphs**. The new `DbContext.AttachGraph` API helps re-attach entities to a context in order to save new/modified entities.
		
* SaveChanges
 * **Basic save functionality** allows changes to entity instances to be persisted to the database.
 * **Optimistic Concurrency** protects against overwriting changes made by another user since data was fetched from the database.
 * **Async SaveChanges** can free up the current thread to process other requests while the database processes the commands issued from `SaveChanges`.
 * **Transactions** means that `SaveChanges` is always atomic (meaning it either completely succeeds, or no changes are made to the database). There are also transaction related APIs to allow sharing transactions between context instances etc.
 * **Relational: Batching of statements** provides better performance by batching up multiple INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE commands into a single roundtrip to the database.
		
* Query
 * **Basic LINQ support** provides the ability to use LINQ to retrieve data from the database.
 * **Mixed client/server evaluation** enables queries to contain logic that cannot be evaluated in the database, and must therefore be evaluated after the data is retrieved into memory.
 * **NoTracking** queries enables quicker query execution when the context does not need to monitor for changes to the entity instances (i.e. the results are read-only).
 * **Eager loading** provides the `Include` and `ThenInclude` methods to identify related data that should also be fetched when querying.
 * **Async query** can free up the current thread to process other requests while the database processes the query.
 * **Raw SQL queries** provides the `DbSet.FromSql` method to use raw SQL queries to fetch data. These queries can also be composed on using LINQ.

* Database schema management 		
 * **Database creation/deletion APIs** are mostly designed for testing where you want to quickly create/delete the database without using migrations.
 * **Relational database migrations** allow a relational database schema to evolve overtime as your model changes.
 * **Reverse engineer from database** scaffolds an EF model based on an existing relational database schema.

* Database providers
 * **EntityFramework.SqlServer** connects to Microsoft SQL Server 2008 onwards.
 * **EntityFramework.Sqlite** connects to a SQLite 3 database.
 * **EntityFramework.InMemory** is designed to easily enable testing without connecting to a real database.
 * **Postgres** support is being developed by [Npgsql](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql)
 * **SQL Compact** support is being developed by [ErikEJ](https://github.com/ErikEJ/EntityFramework7.SqlServerCompact)

* Platforms
 * **Full .NET** includes Console, WPF, WinForms, ASP.NET 4, etc.
 * **.NET Core (including ASP.NET Core)** targeting both Full.NET and .NET Core on Windows, OSX, and Linux.
 * **Universal Windows Platform (UWP)** applications can make use of the SQLite provider to access local data
	
#### In Progress

As we wrap up the 1.0.0 release, we are focused on the following areas:
 * **Bug fixing** to improvement the overall quality and reliability.
 * **LINQ provider improvements** to increase the number of LINQ queries that can successfully execute, and increase the parts of the query that can be translated to execute in the database.
 * **Performance improvements** to address the identified bottlenecks.
 * **Documentation** is being developed in the [EntityFramework.Docs](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFramework.Docs) repository.
 * **IntelliSense documentation** allow contextual help within Visual Studio when using the EF APIs.
 

### Backlog Features

This is by no means an exhaustive list, but calls out some of the important features that are not yet implemented in EF Core.

#### Critical O/RM features

The things we think we need before we say EF Core is the recommended version of EF. Until we implement these features EF Core will be a valid option for many applications, especially on platforms such as UWP and .NET Core where EF6.x does not work, but for many applications the lack of these features will make EF6.x a better option.

* Query
 * **Improved translation** will enable more queries to successfully execute, with more logic being evaluated in the database (rather than in-memory).
  * **GroupBy translation** will move translation of the LINQ GroupBy operator to the database, rather than in-memory.
 * **Lazy loading** enables navigation properties to be automatically populated from the database when they are accessed.
 * **Explicit Loading** allows you to trigger population of a navigation property on an entity that was previously loaded from the database.

* Database schema management 
 * **Update model from database** allows a model that was previously reverse engineered from the database to be refreshed with changes made to the schema.

* Modelling
 * **Complex/value types** are types that do not have a primary key and are used to represent a set of properties on an entity type.

* Change Tracking
 * **Missing EntityEntry APIs from EF6.x** such as `Reload`, `GetModifiedProperties`, `GetDatabaseValues` etc.

* Relational specific
 * **Stored procedure mapping** allows EF to use stored procedures to persist changes to the database (`FromSql` already provides good support for using a stored procedure to query).
 * **Connection resiliency** automatically retries failed database commands. This is especially useful when connection to SQL Azure, where transient failures are common.
 
#### High priority features

There are many features on our backlog and this is by no means an exhaustive list. These features are high priority but we think EF Core would be a compelling release for the vast majority of applications without them

* Modelling
 * **More flexible property mapping**, such as constructor parameters, get/set methods, property bags, etc.
 * **Visualizing a model** to see a graphical representation of the code-based model.
 * **Simple type conversions** such as string => xml.
 * **Spatial data types** such as SQL Server's `geography` & `geometry`.
 * **Many-to-many relationships** without join entity. You can already [model a many-to-many relationship with a join entity](https://docs.efproject.net/en/latest/modeling/relationships.html#many-to-many).
 * **Alternate inheritance mapping patterns** for relational databases, such as table per type (TPT) and table per concrete type TPC.

* CRUD
 * **Seed data** allows a set of data to be easily upserted.
 * **ETag-style concurrency token support** 
 * **Eager loading rules** allow a default set of related data to always be retrieved when an entity is queried.
 * **Filtered loading** allows a subset of related entities to be loaded.
 * **Simple command interception** provides an easy way to read/write commands before/after they are sent to the database.

* Providers
 * **Azure Table Storage**
 * **Redis**
 * **Other non-relational databases**
