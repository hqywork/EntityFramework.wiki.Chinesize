# What is EF Core all about?

The purpose of this page is to provide a starting point for folks who want to learn about EF Core. We'll keep it updated with links to relevant information as we release it.

## EF Core in 100 words or less

EF Core is a lightweight and extensible version of Entity Framework that enables new platforms and new data stores. Starting with EF Core, Windows Phone, Windows Store, ASP.NET Core, and traditional desktop application can all now take advantage of Entity Framework. In addition to relational databases, EF Core also supports non-relational data stores such as Azure Table Storage and Redis.

## Digging a little deeper

The "elevator pitch" is easy, but what does that really mean. Here are a few blog posts that dig into the changes coming in EF Core:
