# Entity Framework
Entity Framework is Microsoft's recommended data access technology for new applications in .NET. 

Entity Framework Core (EF Core) provides a familiar developer experience to EF6.x, including LINQ, POCO, and Code First support. EF Core also enables access to data across relational and non-relational stores. EF Core is much more lightweight than previous versions and is built from the ground up to work great in the cloud (using ASP.NET vNext) on devices (i.e. in universal Windows apps) as well as in traditional .NET scenarios.
