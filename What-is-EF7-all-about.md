# What is EF7 all about?

The purpose of this page is to provide a starting point for folks who want to learn about EF7. We'll keep it updated with links to relevant information as we release it.

## EF7 in 100 words or less

EF7 is a lightweight and extensible version of Entity Framework that enables new platforms and new data stores. Starting with EF7, Windows Phone, Windows Store, ASP.NET 5, and traditional desktop application can all now take advantage of Entity Framework. In addition to relational databases, EF7 also supports non-relational data stores such as Azure Table Storage and Redis.

## Digging a little deeper

The "elevator pitch" is easy, but what does that really mean. Here are a few blog posts that dig into the changes coming in EF7:

## Trying it out

The best way to try out EF7 is to make use of our nightly builds. You can find information on nightly builds, as well as some getting started examples, on our [Getting Started with Nightly Builds](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFramework/wiki/Getting-Started-with-Nightly-Builds) page.

As you try out EF7 please bear in mind that this is a very early stage in the development of the new EF codebase and there are many features that are partially implemented or not yet available.
