# Entity Framework Design Meeting Notes

The Entity Framework team has a weekly design meeting in which we discuss/recap design and other issues with the codebase. These are the notes from those meetings. The intention is to provide a history of what decisions have been made and why. No attempt is made to go back and update notes from older meetings if we later change a decision and decide to do something different.
